# Portfolio-copy

> A personal portfolio website template — showcasing projects and skills in a clean, responsive design.

## 💡 Project Overview

This project is a web-based personal portfolio built using modern frontend tooling. It serves as a customizable template for demonstrating your work, skills, and contact information.

Use this portfolio to:

* Showcase your projects / coding work
* Present your skills, experience, and credentials
* Provide a clean, professional “about-me / contact-me” page for recruiters, collaborators or clients

## 🚀 Built With / Tech Stack

* **Vite** — as build tool and dev server
* **React** (with **TypeScript**) — for UI and logic
* **Tailwind CSS** — for styling and layout

You may optionally extend or customize the stack as needed (e.g. add more styling, backend, deploy to static site hosting, etc.).

## 🎯 Getting Started / Usage

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

* Node.js (v16+ recommended)
* npm (or yarn / pnpm) — whichever you prefer

### Installation & Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TanayV24/Portflio-copy.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Portflio-copy
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in terminal) to see your portfolio locally.

### Build for Production

When you’re ready to deploy or share:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then serve the `dist` (or build) folder on any static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).

## ✨ Customization Suggestions

* Replace placeholder content (your name, bio, skills, project descriptions) with your real data.
* Update styling and theme (colors, fonts) via Tailwind config for a personal touch.
* Add more sections (e.g. blog, testimonials, contact form) as needed.
* Link to your real projects / GitHub repos so visitors can see your work live.

## 📬 Contact / Showcasing

If you use this portfolio template, you can add your contact details (email, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.) so visitors or recruiters can reach you.

You can also use this repo as a starting point for a public “portfolio site” — showcasing what you build, learn, or design, and evolving it over time as your skills grow.
